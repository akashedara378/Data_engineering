🧠 What is Kafka Connect?
Kafka Connect is a tool that helps you move data in and out of Apache Kafka easily and reliably — without writing custom code.

📦 Think of it like a data pipeline plug-and-play system:

You have data sources like databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), cloud storage (S3), or applications.
You have data sinks like Elasticsearch, another database, or even a file system.
Kafka Connect acts as a bridge between these sources/sinks and Kafka topics.


🔌 How it works:


You use Connectors:

Source Connector: pulls data from a system into Kafka.
Sink Connector: pushes data from Kafka into another system.



You configure these connectors using simple JSON files or REST APIs.



🛠️ Example:
Let’s say you want to stream data from a PostgreSQL database to Elasticsearch:

Source Connector reads rows from PostgreSQL and writes them to a Kafka topic.
Sink Connector reads from that Kafka topic and writes to Elasticsearch.

No need to write custom code — just configure the connectors!

✅ Benefits:

Scalable: Handles large volumes of data.
Fault-tolerant: Automatically retries and recovers from failures.
Pluggable: Many pre-built connectors available.
Managed: Can run in standalone or distributed mode.
