# Apache Airflow: Operators and Executors

Apache Airflow is built around two essential components: **Operators** and **Executors**. Here's a concise breakdown you can include in your documentation.

## 🛠️ Operators in Airflow

**Operators** define _what gets done_ in each task. They are the building blocks of your DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs).

### ✅ Types of Operators

| Category             | Examples                                         | Description                                                             |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Action Operators      | `BashOperator`, `PythonOperator`                 | Run shell commands or Python code.                                     |
| Transfer Operators    | `S3ToRedshiftOperator`, `GCSToBigQueryOperator`  | Move data between systems (e.g., S3 to Redshift).                       |
| Sensor Operators      | `S3KeySensor`, `ExternalTaskSensor`              | Wait for a condition to be true (file exists, task complete, etc.).     |
| Trigger Operators     | `TriggerDagRunOperator`                          | Trigger another DAG.                                                    |
| Branch Operators      | `BranchPythonOperator`                           | Choose task path conditionally (like if/else for DAGs).                 |
| Dummy/Empty Operator  | `EmptyOperator`                                  | Useful for structuring the DAG.                                         |
| Custom Operators      | Inherit `BaseOperator`                           | For custom task logic.                                                  |

## ⚙️ Executors in Airflow

**Executors** define _how tasks are run_ in the background. They determine the mechanism by which Airflow runs the operators.

### ✅ Types of Executors

| Executor                 | Description                                                    | Ideal Use Case                            |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `SequentialExecutor`     | Runs one task at a time. Default with SQLite.                  | For testing and development only.          |
| `LocalExecutor`          | Runs tasks in parallel using subprocesses.                    | Small-scale or local production setups.    |
| `CeleryExecutor`         | Distributes tasks using Celery and a message broker.          | Production setups needing scalability.     |
| `KubernetesExecutor`     | Launches tasks as pods in Kubernetes.                         | Cloud-native, scalable environments.       |
| `DaskExecutor`           | Uses Dask for parallel processing.                            | Python-heavy distributed workloads.        |
| `CeleryKubernetesExecutor` _(deprecated)_ | Hybrid of Celery and K8s.                            | Legacy setups combining both models.       |

## 🔁 Summary

- **Operators** = _What_ your DAG does (run scripts, move data, etc.)
- **Executors** = _How_ your tasks are executed (locally, on Celery workers, or Kubernetes)

> ✅ Tip: Always choose your executor based on your scalability needs and infrastructure (e.g., use KubernetesExecutor for containerized environments).
